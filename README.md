# Message DApp
This project is a simple dApp that takes message input and saves it in the smart contract. You can retrieve the message from the smart contract.
Before you initiate the transaction, you sign the transaction with your private key. Don't worry, your wallet does that for you.
Once your wallet is connected, you do not need to connect your wallet again to retrieve your message from your contract.
If you're getting your message to get in touch with your wallet, you first need to connect.
It's a very simple dApp that relies on smart contracts.
